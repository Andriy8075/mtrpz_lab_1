# Quadratic Equation Solver

## How to use:
1. clone repo
2. open folder with project in terminal

### For interactive mode:
print "py main.py" in terminal

### For non-interactive mode:
1. prepare file with format "6/s0.348/s-6,47/n" (6 0.348 -6,47). /s - space, /n -carriage return. Just file with separated by space 3 numbers a, b and c: coefficients in quadratic_equation ax^2+bx+c=0
2. launch command "py main.py filepath".

    If file is in the project directory, you can specify relative path like "py main.py coefficients.txt"

    For any file location on you machine, you can specify absolute path:

    "py main.py C:\some_intermediate_folders\coefficients.txt"
